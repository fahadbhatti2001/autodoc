            <h1>HOW AUTODOC WORKS? </h1>
            <p>
              Autodoc is an advanced fault diagnostics system that uses AI to
              accurately detect and diagnose issues with car engines. Our system
              works by gathering data from your car's sensors and other sources
              in real-time, and then using advanced machine learning algorithms
              to analyze that data and detect any potential issues. To use
              Autodoc, simply plug our device into your car's OBD-II port (which
              is usually located underneath the dashboard) and connect to our
              mobile app. Our app will guide you through the diagnostic process
              step by step, providing real-time feedback on your engine's
              performance and identifying any issues that need to be addressed.
            </p>

            <p>
              Overall, Autodoc is the ultimate tool for car owners who want to
              stay on top of their engine's performance and keep their vehicle
              running smoothly. With Autodoc, you can diagnose issues quickly,
              prevent costly repairs, and stay safe on the road.

              Automobile sound scope is a staple in the auto-mechanicâ€™s toolbox,
              and when one is not available, long flat screwdrivers are used to
              similar effect.Based on that principle of identifying specific
              sounds, AutoDoc Team has nearly perfected an AI-powered fault
              detection and diagnosis system.

              The human brain can easily distinguish between cats and dogs,
              apples and oranges, but an AI must be taught by countless images
              as examples. This is a grossly simplified but generally
              descriptive of machine learning.
